            <h2>Who we are</h2>
            <p class = description>This will be a paragraph about us and how cool we are.<br>Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to 
                say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They 
                were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything 
                strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such 
                nonsense. 
                
                Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which 
                made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, 
                although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was 
                thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, 
                which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning 
                over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a 
                small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer 
                boy anywhere. </p>

            <p>This will be a paragraph about what we are working on at the moment. In the future, it's possible that I will add some sort of archive page or something so website visitors can look at past projects.The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a 
                secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover 
                it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about 
                the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t 
                met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn’t 
                have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband 
                were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys 
                shuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters 
                arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a 
                small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was 
                another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t 
                want Dudley mixing with a child like that. </p>
